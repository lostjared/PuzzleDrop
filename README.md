2D Puzzle Game

In this game, your objective is to manipulate blocks by moving them horizontally using the left and right arrow keys. Utilize the 'A' and 'S' keys to shift the blocks, and the 'Z' and 'X' keys to rotate them. Your goal is to align patterns of identical colors in sequences of 1-2-3 or 3-2-1, forming either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal lines. There is also a special wildcard block that cycles through various colors and can match with any other block. Aim to clear as many lines as possible to advance in the game.
